 **Sales-Profitability-Analysis**
 
Interactive PowerBI report with DAX calculations, KPLs and sales performance insighs.
This project presents an interactive ‘Sales & Profitability Dashboard ‘ built with powerBI, based on the same dataset I’ve used for the excel project. The aim is to analyze sales, trends, profit margin and key insights to support business decisions.

The project Overview:
-Key Metrics: Total sales, Gross profit, Profit Margin.
Segmentation Analysis:
-Sales and Profit by Product category, Customer segment and Region.
Interactive Visualisation:
-Users can explore trends over time, segment performance and product level insights.
DAX Measures
-Total Sales
-Total Gross Profit
-Percentage Sales per Segment
The Dataset used for this project is “Superstore Dataset”
Tool used:
Data Visualization & Modeling: PowerBI
Version Control: GitHub

Critical insights:
The analysis focuses on a significant negative profit margin and isolates the main driver: excessive discounts application (over 30%) which fully erodes gross profit.
